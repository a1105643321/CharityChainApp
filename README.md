# Charity Chain

Inspired by the champion of blockchain hackathon. We look high of its significant meaning to
society, as lack of detail of their implementation, we decide to try it in our way.

## What's the problem we aim to solving

* Where(how) the money come from: an app for donator who could select one project to donate.
* How the money used: an app for non-profit organization to organize receiver and assign donations.
* Where the money go: the track function in donator app, which shows the unique id of transaction.

## Notes

Although I have experiences in js development especially in nodejs, AngularJS and jQuery, this is my
first Angular 2 project with help of Ionic 2, also first time developing in Visual Studio Code.
Thanks to these great tools, I'm really enjoying the development process.
